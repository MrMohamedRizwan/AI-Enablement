However, specifics about our own company's current hiring metrics were not directly provided from HR Policy Search; the query returned hybrid work policy information instead of hiring data.\n",

      "Industry benchmarks in 2024 show overall employment growth, strategic and cautious hiring, and heightened talent competition—especially in growing sectors like healthcare and social assistance. Trends include increased focus on retention, pre-employment assessments, and compensation benchmarking. \n",

      "Based on available policy information, our organization currently emphasizes a hybrid work policy. However, specific hiring metrics from our company were not retrievable in existing HR policy documents, so an exact numerical comparison is not possible. If more detailed internal hiring data is available elsewhere, a more precise comparison can be made. For now, our emphasis on flexible work aligns with broader industry shifts towards adaptability and employee preferences in recruitment.\u001b[0m\n",
